## Why I Built This 🤔

**I was frustrated coding with DeepSeek and Z.AI.**

I wanted to achieve the same quality of work as premium models like **Gemini 3 Pro** and **Claude Opus**, but with affordable models.
For developers who chose **budget-friendly subscriptions** instead of expensive plans, I built a multi-agent system that can **autonomously complete** complex engineering tasks even with mid-tier LLMs.

> *"Intelligence is a resource. Orchestrate it."*

---

## What is this?

A **5-agent autonomous architecture** designed to solve complex engineering tasks with high reliability, even on mid-range LLMs.

**Core Philosophy**: Intelligence is a resource. We orchestrate that resource through **Phase-based Workflows** and **Mandatory Environment Scans** to ensure code always fits the project's infrastructure.

> 🦀 **Powered by Rust** — Background tasks and parallel searches run on native Rust binaries for maximum performance.

### Key Features
- **🎯 Autonomous Loop** — Commander runs relentlessly until the mission is complete.
- **🔍 Environment Scan** — Mandatory analysis of Infra (Docker/OS), Stack, and Domain before any code change.
- **🔨 Smart Implementation** — Builder matches existing codebase patterns exactly.
- **🛡️ Rigorous Audit** — Inspector proves success with environment-specific evidence (Builds/Tests/Logs).
- **💾 Persistent Context** — Recorder saves session state to disk, enabling resume at any time.
- **🏗️ Parallel Tasking** — Architect splits work into concurrent DAG groups.
- **⏳ Background Tasks** — Run long commands (builds, tests) in background and check results later.
- **🔎 mgrep** — Multi-pattern parallel search powered by Rust for blazing-fast codebase analysis.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g opencode-orchestrator
```

Restart OpenCode after installation.

## Usage

### 🚀 Method 1: Select Commander via Tab Key (Recommended)

In OpenCode, press `Tab` to open the Agent selection menu. Select **Commander** and type your mission!

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/commander-screenshot.png" alt="Commander Screenshot" width="600" />
  <p><em>Press Tab to select Commander</em></p>
</div>

```
"Fix the login bug in the docker-compose environment"
```

The Commander will:
1. **Survey**: Scan the Docker environment and codebase.
2. **Plan**: Break the fix into steps.
3. **Execute**: Call Builder to fix while matching patterns.
4. **Verify**: Run builds/tests to prove the fix works.
5. **Complete**: Report results with concrete evidence.

### 📋 Method 2: Use /task Command

```bash
/task "Implement user authentication with JWT"
```

> **💡 Tip:** Using the `/task` command makes Commander mode run **2x longer**.
> Use `/task` for complex tasks that need extended processing!

## Agents (5-Agent Architecture)

| Agent | Emoji | Role | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commander** | 🎯 | Orchestrator | Autonomous mission control & delegation |
| **Architect** | 🏗️ | Planner | Task decomposition & strategy correction |
| **Builder** | 🔨 | Developer | Full-stack implementation (Logic + UI) |
| **Inspector** | 🔍 | Quality | 5-point audit & automatic bug fixing |
| **Recorder** | 💾 | Context | Persistent environment & progress tracking |

---

## The Workflow (Progressive Phases)

1. **Phase 0: Triage (Smart)**
   - **Fast Track 🟢**: Simple fixes → Execute instantly (Skip heavy scans).
   - **Deep Track 🔴**: Complex features → Full Environment Scan & Plan.
2. **Phase 1: Environment Scan**
   - Mandatory for Deep Track: Infra/Domain/Stack analysis.
3. **Phase 2: Parallel Planning**
   - Architect creates a DAG of atomic tasks (Scalable Planning).
4. **Phase 3: Execution & Audit**
   - Builder writes code ↔ Inspector verifies with evidence.
5. **Phase 4: Completion**
   - Mission Complete reported with proof of build/test success.

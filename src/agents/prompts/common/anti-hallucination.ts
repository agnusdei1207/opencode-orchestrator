ZERO TOLERANCE FOR GUESSING

## The Golden Rule
> If you're not 100% sure, **SEARCH** before you claim.
> If you can't find it, **SAY** you can't find it.

## Before ANY Implementation:

### Step 1: Check Local Cache
\`\`\`bash
ls ${PATHS.DOCS}/  # What do we already have?
\`\`\`

### Step 2: If Not Found -> Research
- Search for OFFICIAL documentation
- Prefer version-specific docs matching project
- Cache findings to ${PATHS.DOCS}/

### Step 3: Verify Before Using
- Is this the RIGHT version for THIS project?
- Does the syntax match current APIs?
- Are there breaking changes to consider?

## Source Hierarchy (Most to Least Trusted):
1. [Trusted] **Official docs** - docs.*, *.dev, readthedocs
2. [Trusted] **GitHub source** - actual source code, README
3. [Neutral] **Package registries** - npm, PyPI, crates.io, Maven
4. [Neutral] **GitHub issues** - real-world usage patterns
5. [Caution] **Blogs/tutorials** - may be outdated, verify independently

## FORBIDDEN:
- Inventing function signatures from memory
- Assuming API compatibility between versions
- Guessing version-specific syntax
- Using knowledge without verification
- Mixing syntax from different versions

## REQUIRED:
- Source URL for every technical claim
- Confidence level: ${WORK_STATUS.CONFIDENCE.HIGH} (official) / ${WORK_STATUS.CONFIDENCE.MEDIUM} (github) / ${WORK_STATUS.CONFIDENCE.LOW} (blog)
- Say "I need to research this" if unsure
- Say "NOT FOUND in official docs" if documentation unavailable

## Self-Check Questions:
1. Did I VERIFY this, or am I REMEMBERING it?
2. Is my source CURRENT for this project's version?
3. Am I CERTAIN, or am I HOPING?
